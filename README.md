# Embedded-System-Project-Joystick-Controlled-Stepper-Motor
You are to use the MSP-430 Launchpad and Educational BoosterPack MKII we have used this semester to
design a simple motor controller system. Your design will provide control for a single stepper motor. You
must only use the components authorized by the course instructor for this project, but may request to use a
component that is not on the authorized list. If your request is granted, the component will be made available
to all students
# Joystick Controller and Display
We will use a 2-axis joystick with pushbutton located in the MKII Educational Board to enter each mode. A
joystick axis is considered “centered” if it is between ¼ and ¾ of its maximum position. Your design
parameters will be provided to you upon your group’s registration. Follow the directions given in class
regarding what information to display
